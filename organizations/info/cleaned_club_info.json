        "membership_type": "\nSection 5.1 - Membership Fees\nThe membership fee is $15 paid directly to the club. The membership fee must be paid by the second-last general meeting. Under special conditions, the fee may be waived with majority approval of the Executive Members. Members may require uniforms and attire for public performances; these costs are not covered by the membership fee and will require the payment of an additional fee beyond membership. Members will be given at least one month's notification of these charges. While uniform costs do not need to be paid to attain or retain membership with the club, they may be mandatory to partake in public performances. Members electing not to pay uniform costs must inform the executive within the first month of their membership, will be provided a shirt for the duration of the concert, to be returned immediately afterwards.\nMembership fees will be used and budgeted each term for:\n1.\tSheet Music and Other Copyright Expenses (see Section 5.2)\n2.\tRental/Purchase of Percussion Instruments (see Section 5.3)\n3.\tRental Subsidies for Instruments (see Section 5.4)\n4.\tAdministration Fees (see Section 5.5)\n5.\tMembership Appreciation Expenses (see Section 5.6)\n6.\tOther Expenses (see Section 5.7)\nSection 5.2 - Sheet Music and Other Copyright Expenses\nTo ensure a variety of music from term to term, new sheet music can be purchased each term. Sheet music purchases are the responsibility of the Conductor(s) for the term. The Conductor(s) may only purchase sheet music that is intended to be played during the Conductor(s)'s term.\nSince most concert band repertoire is not public domain, the club may use the membership fees to cover any appropriate copyright costs required to use the music.\nSection 5.3 - Rental/Purchase of Percussion Instruments\nPercussion instrument rentals may make up the largest expense funded by membership fees. It is a reasonable expense since concert bands percussionists are not expected to own their own instruments (due to their price and size). Also, percussion instruments are fundamental to concert bands and benefit every member and the band as a whole.\nAdditional funds will be budgeted for the purchase of percussion instruments, or put into savings for purchases in future terms. Purchases will be approved by a majority vote of current Executive Members on a per term basis.\nSection 5.4 - Rental Subsidies for Instruments\nDepending on the balance of the band for the term, the requirements of the music being played, and the costs associated with renting an instrument, the club may offer a small subsidy to partially cover the cost of the rental. The value of the rental will depend on the instrument being rented, but it will not exceed the value one month of rental of the instrument from an official company (rental subsidies will not cover Warriors Band rentals).\nTo apply for a rental subsidy, members must submit a request to the club. Requests may not be made before the club's first general meeting of the term. The rental subsidy request requires approval of both the Primary Conductor and the majority of the Club Executives. Requests are to be processed within term of submission. All approved requests are conditional on the applicant being an active member of the club and not missing more than two general meetings, without approval of extenuating circumstances by the Club Executives. The applicant is responsible for arranging the rental and providing the club with receipts as proof of the rental. If the approved request meets all of the necessary conditions, the subsidy will be paid out at the last general meeting of the term.\nSection 5.5 - Administration Fees\nThere are many administrative expenses associated with running a successful band. These include, but are not limited to:\n1.\tMarketing and advertising expenses\n2.\tInformation technology expenses\n3.\tPhotocopying and printing expenses\n4.\tVenue rental expenses\nSection 5.6 - Membership Appreciation Expenses\nA portion of membership fees will be budgeted for membership appreciation activities including, but not limited to:\n1.\tProviding food and refreshments at concerts and socials\n2.\tProviding memorabilia for participation in a given term.\nSection 5.7 - Other Expenses\nOther expenses will be budgeted as deemed necessary by Executive Officers.\nSection 5.8 - Membership Fee Refund Policy\nUnder no circumstances will membership fees be refunded to members.\nSection 5.9 - Reimbursement Policy\nTo prevent the club from accumulating debt to its members, any expense incurred must be processed at latest one academic term after the term in which the cash expenditure took place.\nSection 5.10 - Active Members\nTo be considered an active member of the band, an individual must have paid their membership fees for the term and attended at least one rehearsal. In the event that membership fees are waived for some or all members, via majority Executive vote (Section 5.1), any such member is considered an active member of the band if they have attended at least one rehearsal.\n\n",

As well, UW SSA attempts to participate in a wide range of multi-cultural activities both on campus, and within the Sikh community (such as trips to the Gurdwara, Vaisakhi, etc).In addition, our club organizes a number of intramural co-ed sports teams (Basketball and Volleyball, usually) and social functions (pool tournaments, bowling, etc.) and outings (dinners, horseback riding, skiing trips) that form the bulk of our time commitments.We hope to create a 'family' atmosphere by developing an hierarchy-less club that is devoted to providing an avenue for interaction amongst Sikh students at our University. UW SSA also provides educational help (study groups, old texts, exams, etc.) and holds one of the most successful on-campus events, 'Dastaar day', previously known as 'Turban Day' once a semester. This is an awareness day to teach the University community about the significance of the turban in Sikhism. We desire to produce conditions conducive to the further study, research and practice of Sikhism by our fellow Sikh students and all others interested in any aspect of the Sikh religion.",
